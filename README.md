# ODDS AWARENESS PROJECT
### The Architecture of Loss.

The digital gambling industry is a mathematical trap designed for your financial depletion. This project is a professional manifesto that deconstructs the psychological and algorithmic tactics used by skin betting sites. 

Before you place your next bet, understand the reality. Information is your only winning move.
